const soilHealth = `The most important goal of conversion is to enhance soil health.
 We want to have soilthat has good structure and a lot of organic matter, and soil biological activity. Organic
matter produces substances that allow soil particles to aggregate, with lots of micropores
where water and air can permeate. Soil organic matter provides the fuel for microbes and
meso- and macro-fauna. Through decomposition, the soil microbes mineralize minerals
that become used by plants. Just 10 grams of soil contain millions of organisms that interact
in very complex food webs.
As the microbial biomass is concentrated in the top layer of the soil, we have to protect
topsoil. Large quantities of organic matter Â– different kinds like fresh and dry leaves (cellu-
losic material), branches (lignin), compost, etc. Â– should be applied to soils on a regular
basis. Soil cover should be maintained with cover crops and mulches. Erosion can cause the
30loss of not only nutrients but micro-organisms too, and should be minimized with proper
soil conservation measures. The loss of 1 mm of soil is equivalent to 14 tonnes per ha. To
rebuild that will take 50-100 years with good practices.
The basic ecological principles behind soil biological management are:
Â•
Â•
Â•
Â•
Â•
Â•
Â•
Â•
The supply of organic material for food. There are two types of organic material, labile
and non-labile. Labile organic matter decomposes quickly and usually comes from leaves
and straw. Non-labile material decomposes more slowly, such as lignins and branches
from trees. A mixture of both labile and non-labile material is needed to produce good
organic matter. Material that decomposes quickly provides nutrients while those that
decompose slowly give structure to the soil. Farmers also need to stimulate soil organ-
isms with good temperature, nutrients and air.
Increased plant diversity. Many plants release substances from roots (root exudates).
Each exudate stimulates a different population of bacteria. The more the exudates, the
more complex the soil microbiology near the roots.
Maintain good soil structure to stimulate microbes and improve water, air, temperature
and nutrient conditions.
Use different types of organic materials because they have different effects on soil
biological, chemical and physical properties.
Keep soil covered with living vegetation and/or crop residues by using cover crops, sod
crops in rotations, and/or reduced tillage practices. This encourages water to infiltrate
into the soil instead of running off the field, taking sediments (and organic matter)
along.
Reduce soil compaction to a minimum by keeping off fields when they are too wet,
redistributing loads, using traffic lanes, etc.
Use a variety of practices to reduce erosion. These include some mentioned above,
such as keeping soil covered with living vegetation or crop residues (using cover crops,
rotation sod crops, and reducing tillage), as well as other practices such as terracing,
grassed waterways, strip cropping along the contour by alternating a row crop with a
sod crop, using natural or planted buffers between fields and streams, etc.
Use practices to supply supplemental fertility sources, when needed, that better match
nutrient availability to crop uptake needs (which vary during the season). This helps to
reduce both weed and insect damage.
When we add organic matter, we increase the carbon in the soil and create conditions
for balanced biota. The food web in the soil becomes very complex, with bacteria, fungi,
nematodes and protozoa all playing a role. Some soil organisms feed on other organisms
and control their populations; for example, there are nematodes that eat fungi and vice
31versa. Other micro-organisms mineralize nutrients, others protect crops against pathogens
and others produce plant-growth-promoting hormones (Figure 8). In the rhizosphere, there
are not just plant roots, but also thousands of beneficial bacteria and fungi that surround the
roots. Mycorrhizae help plants to acquire certain nutrients such as phosphorus and improve
water use efficiency. If there is drought, crops with mycorrhizae survive better than crops
without. Mycorrhizae also cover roots and protect them against pathogens. It is difficult to
introduce mycorrhizae into a planted field. It is best to harvest litter from a nearby natural
forest, which has a lot of mycorrhizae, and then incorporate this material in the compost so
as to inoculate it.`;
let pesticides = `Resistance to pesticides by pests has given rise to an
addiction to pesticides. Chemical pesticides do not work eventually because insects and
weeds develop resistance, so we have to develop new pesticides and apply more; this is
called the Â“pesticide treadmillÂ”.`;

ty with high recycling rates, use low external inputs, are resilient and efficient in use of
local resources, and have a high level of synergy and integration.`;
